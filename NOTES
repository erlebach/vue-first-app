- Choose a node (hardcode for now). 
- List all the outbound flights. These are the out-degree neighbors
- List all the inbound flights. These are the in-degree neighbors
- List them in a Table, below the city table.

- FlightsInAir works on its own. And I can change times. I am not using vuex
- FlightsInAir and CityTable do not work together. I get an error when 
I either 1) type a new city, or type in a new time.  
REASON: must have to do with how I am reading the data. Somehow, I am must
be interacting the two components. 
  (2021-08-14: both now work. I added some conditionals. I have to remove 
  colorByCity.vue from CityTable and put it in CityGraph*.vue)

Ideally, I want to have a singleton class to read the data from multiple locations. Alternatively, some intelligent cache mechanism. 

But I also need the capability to switch input files. The current class-based 
approach takes the file name as a constructor. This should work as long as 
the components are completely decoupled. But they are not. A table has elements
that when selected might point to the graph. 

I might want the various graphs to always be properly related to each other. 
Not clear what this means as yet. 

For now, I should be concerned with maintainability and flexibility, but 
not efficiency. Otherwise, I will never get a demo going. 

Another problem to solve: 
- I can watch(load.isDataLoaded()), but I cannot watch a computed value
defined in FlightsInAir.vue. So the following works: 

  watch(load.isDataLoaded(), (curVal, old) => {....}

But the following does NOT work: 

const isDataLoaded = computed(() => {
      return load.isDataLoaded();
    });

  watch(isDataLoaded, (curVal, old) => {....}

NOTE: load.isDataLoaded() returns a ref().

Even if the flight from MIA does not have an arrival delay, there is still delay propagation because of the feeders connecting to the departing flights from PTY that are connected to the inbound flight from MIA. I should probably set the arrival times and all departure times of all flights downstream of the original flight from MIA to be their scheduled values. Rotation is still not taken into account.
